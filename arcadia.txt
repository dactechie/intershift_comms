So, we require:
-          A forum that all Arcadia staff can access to read and write in
-          More than one person being able to write in it at once
-          If it can be altered it needs to be obvious that it has been
-          Would also be good to have some kind of function that noted it had been read each staff member
Thatâ€™s my thoughts for now.
